// Problem Description – Retry with Exponential Backoff and Jitter

// You are required to implement a retry mechanism for an asynchronous task that fails. 
// On each retry, the delay before the next attempt should increase, and a small random “jitter”
// should be added to the delay to prevent synchronized retries that can overload a server. 
// The process should stop once the task succeeds or the maximum retry limit is reached.
async function retryWithJitter(fn, retries = 3, baseDelay = 1000) {
  let attempt = 0;

  while (attempt <= retries) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (err) {
      if (attempt === retries) {
        throw err;
      }

      attempt++;

      const maxDelay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1);
      const jitter = Math.random() * maxDelay;
      const delay = baseDelay + jitter; // ✅ never below baseDelay
